Grand Master Bitz:<br>
Welcome to the Fighters Guild! I am Grand Master Bitz, head of this Guild. Since you ask, I suppose I can tell you about the class transfer... but if you actually want to undertake it, you'll have to return to Aden Kingdom. Only those who have deeply experienced the world are qualified for the class transfer.<br>
