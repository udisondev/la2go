<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Cliff:<br>
Oh, welcome , welcome. Heavy eh? Put down your stuff...<br>This is a secure warehouse that is managed by the Dwarven bank union. Once you have deposited your items, I can give your items total security until the person who will take them comes. I mean, in all of history have you ever heard of a warehouse, managed by a Dwarf, being robbed? I bet you haven't?<br>
